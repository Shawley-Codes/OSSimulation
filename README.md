# OSSimulation
This is an operating system simulation


The simulation connects to the internet running two tests
	One test sends a package out to "whois.internic.net" with a domain name
	Whois returns information about the domain name, in this case "google.com"
	
	A second test occurs with a different set up creating a http client 
	and recieving information about the host the client connected to, in this case "google.com"

The simulation also provides basic file management, allowing the user to create files
